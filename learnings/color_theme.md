## 🌈 Color Psychology & Choices

### Primary Palette

* **1. Coral Pink ($\#ff6b6b$) - Main Accent**
    * **Why:** Evokes **warmth and passion** for movies, stands out without being aggressive, associated with entertainment and creativity, gender-neutral appeal, and provides high contrast for accessibility.
    * **Usage:** Primary buttons, highlights, active states, borders.

* **2. Teal ($\#4ecdc4$) - Secondary Accent**
    * **Why:** Creates **visual balance** with warm coral, represents trust and reliability, provides a vintage aesthetic connection (70s/80s color schemes), and complements pink without competing.
    * **Usage:** Search button, secondary actions, interactive elements.

* **3. Butter Yellow ($\#ffe66d$) - Tertiary Accent**
    * **Why:** Evokes **joy and optimism**, references vintage movie posters, high visibility for important UI elements, and works well for labels and navigation.
    * **Usage:** Navigation buttons, rating badges, decorative elements.

* **4. Peach ($\#ffb4a2$) & Mint Green ($\#b8e994$) - Supporting Colors**
    * **Why:** Complete the **vintage confectionery aesthetic**, provide variety without overwhelming, soft approachable tones that reduce eye strain, and create depth in gradients.
    * **Usage:** Text shadows, gradients, hover states.

### Background Colors

* **Warm Gradient (Cream $\to$ Peach $\to$ Pink)**
    * **Why:** Creates an **immersive environment**, reduces harsh white backgrounds for comfortable viewing, mimics sunset/golden hour cinema lighting, provides depth, and makes content feel "wrapped" in warmth.

## 🎭 Typography Decisions

* **Font Choice:** Sans-Serif (**Segoe UI / Comic Sans MS fallback**)
    * **Why:** Rounded, friendly forms match retro aesthetic; high legibility; Comic Sans MS adds **playfulness** as a fallback; system fonts ensure **fast loading times**; professional yet approachable balance.

* **Type Treatments:**
    * **Heavy weights (700-900):** Bold, confident, poster-like look.
    * **Text shadows:** To create the **3D depth** common in 70s-90s design.
    * **Uppercase labels:** To achieve a **vintage signage** aesthetic.

## 🖼️ Visual Design Elements

| Element | Inspiration | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Bold Borders (3-4px solid black)** | Vintage packaging, comic books, retro posters | Creates **strong visual hierarchy**, makes elements feel tangible and interactive, ensures **high contrast**. |
| **2. Drop Shadows (Offset box-shadows)** | 1980s graphic design, early computer interfaces | Creates **3D illusion and depth**, makes UI feel physical and pressable, nostalgic reference to early web design. |
| **3. Rounded Corners (20px border-radius)** | Retro appliances, vintage toys, 70s furniture | **Softens** the bold geometric design, creates a friendly/approachable feel, and balances angular elements. |
| **4. Hover Animations (3D Press Effect)** | Physical button mechanics | Provides **tactile feedback**, makes interface feel responsive and alive, rewards user interaction. |
